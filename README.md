## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 12 or above)
- npm (or yarn)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/khasmir04/time-tracker-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd time-tracker-app
    ```

3. Install the dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the development server and open the application in your default browser. The server will automatically reload the application whenever you make changes to the source code.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build of the application in the dist directory. You can then deploy this build to a web server of your choice.
